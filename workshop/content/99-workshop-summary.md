The code from this tutorial has been used to develop a [live online demo](https://qdrant.to/semantic-search-demo). You can try it to get an intuition for cases when the neural search is useful. The demo contains a switch that selects between neural and full-text searches. You can turn the neural search on and off to compare your result with a regular full-text search.
